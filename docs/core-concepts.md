# Core Concepts

## Architecture Overview

The Solana Swarm Intelligence Framework is built on several key concepts:

### 1. Swarm Intelligence
- Multiple specialized agents work together
- Consensus-based decision making
- Distributed knowledge and capabilities
- Emergent intelligence from agent interactions

### 2. Agent Roles
- **Market Analyzer**: Price and trend analysis
- **Risk Manager**: Risk assessment and position sizing
- **Strategy Optimizer**: Performance optimization
- **Decision Maker**: Final decision coordination
- **Portfolio Manager**: Asset allocation and rebalancing

### 3. Plugin Architecture
- Extensible agent system
- Custom agent development
- Hot-pluggable capabilities
- Standardized interfaces

### 4. Solana Integration
- Native blockchain interaction
- DEX integration (Jupiter, Raydium, Orca)
- Real-time market data
- Transaction execution

## Agent Lifecycle

1. **Initialization**: Agent loads configuration and connects to services
2. **Evaluation**: Agent analyzes context and provides recommendations  
3. **Consensus**: Multiple agents vote on proposed actions
4. **Execution**: Approved actions are executed on-chain
5. **Learning**: Outcomes are recorded for future improvements

## Decision Making Process

1. **Context Gathering**: Collect market data and portfolio state
2. **Agent Analysis**: Each agent evaluates the situation
3. **Proposal Generation**: Create actionable proposals
4. **Consensus Building**: Vote on proposals with confidence scores
5. **Risk Assessment**: Validate safety and risk parameters
6. **Execution**: Execute approved high-confidence actions

## Configuration System

The framework uses a hierarchical configuration system:

- **Global Config**: Framework-wide settings
- **Agent Config**: Agent-specific configuration
- **Plugin Config**: Plugin-specific settings
- **Environment Variables**: Runtime configuration

## Safety and Security

- **Simulation Mode**: Test strategies without real transactions
- **Risk Limits**: Built-in position and loss limits
- **Multi-signature**: Support for multi-sig wallets
- **Audit Trail**: Complete transaction and decision logging
